# DataLake - A modern web application for managing customers

DataLake is a powerful customer management application built with Next.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a modern and convenient way to manage your customer data, all in one place. With the help of an API that fetches data from MongoDB and Redux for state management, DataLake offers a seamless and responsive experience for its users.

Whether you need to view, add, edit, or delete customers from your database, DataLake has got you covered. You can easily search for customers by first and last name, and the application uses dynamic filtering to help you quickly find the customers you're looking for.

But that's not all! In the near future, we plan to add even more exciting features to DataLake. These will include a personalized customer dashboard, the ability to mass-import customers, notifications, and powerful analytics tools. With these additional tools, you'll be able to better understand your customers and make data-driven decisions to drive your business forward.

Join me on this exciting journey to revolutionize customer management with DataLake.
